Research :
* When and why BDD was defined?
  - Around 2008 in order to improve TDD

* The most important aspects of BDD?
  - Have a description of the scenarios to be tested in natural language in order that people outiside develpment whould understand them.

* Why is useful and when could be applied?
  - in order to have and early feedback for the testing scenarios.
  - autodocumented
  - Applied before develpment proccess

* Which type of teams could implement BDD?
  - Any type of team could implement it

* Structure of a feature - Give an example
  - Get all the conference rooms of Jala

* Structure of a user story - Give an example
TITLE: Know the names of the conference rooms
AS A jalasoft engineer
I WANT a list of the conference rooms
SO THAT the conference rooms should be known by their names

* Structure of a scenario - Give an example
GIVEN the engineer is loged into the system
WHEN is typed the conference "1B2"
THEN the system should show "Rohan"

* Differences between BDD and BDT
BDD should involve all develpment team, instead of BDT that write test cases
