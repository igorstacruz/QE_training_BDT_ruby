Feature: search for customers on list

  Scenario: search for customers with filter # search_customer.feature:7
    Given I have login into application      # search_customer.feature:9

  Scenario: search for customers by default # search_customer.feature:11

2 scenarios (1 undefined, 1 passed)
1 step (1 undefined)
0m0.016s

You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given(/^I have login into application$/) do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

If you want snippets in a different programming language,
just make sure a file with the appropriate file extension
exists where cucumber looks for step definitions.
